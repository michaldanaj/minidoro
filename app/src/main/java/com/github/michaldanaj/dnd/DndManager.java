/**
 * [6] DnD mode handler. It chooses right strategy according to API version and granted app privileges
 *
 * NOTE: this class depends on activity context. It wouldn't be so ugly if it wouldn't be used outside of the main activity
 * DndManager is mainly used in work time when activity has never be destroyed (when activity are being destroying work period stops)
 * But it's also used in RingerModeManager to finish up DnD mode (not needed after break time) and get current system DnD mode
 * to avoid ringtone volume change if we're not able to return back DnD mode
 * It seems safe till Android doesn't kill the main activity without services (never seen this yet:
 * Androids 5+ devices where dnd service is used usually have enough memory to not kill activities apart)
 * TODO to think and do something with this mess
